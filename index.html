        <h1>Leap Gesture Trainer for BetterTouchTool</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Leap Motion controller is a small computer device that allows the user to control his computer using your hands and fingers. The idea behind this device is great, and is likely influenced by movies like Minority Report, where Tom Cruise uses a pair of gloves to quickly manipulate windows and other objects.</p>
        <p>In practice, however, Leap Motion falls a bit short. This is expected of any new technology, but the bottom line is that we need some extra work to really get Leap Motion to do what we want. Here's where Better Touch Tool comes in. Better Touch Tool has been around for years, and was primarily designed to allow Mac users to use the full potential of their multitouch trackpads and magic mouse. Recently, BTT also added support for Leap Motion, which is exactly what users felt was missing. With BTT, you can assign gestures to different actions on your computer.</p>
        <p>However, one problem remains...with any new technology requires new skills that one must master before the technology is beneficial. And while most people are used to touch gestures such as tapping, dragging, scrolling, etc., touchless gestures are still new to most people. This is where this tool comes in.</p>
        <p>My goal is to provide a simple tool where users can learn the different gestures used by BTT without having to assign them to real actions. With enough practice, each gesture will become second nature and the user will be able to perform them at will. This is comparable to learn how to touch type. Once you're proficient, you don't have to look at your hands or think about what you're doing in order to perform a gesture. This brings speed and proficience to hand gestures, which I believe is a requirement if we want to improve our productivity using the Leap Motion controller.</p>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>What you'll need:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Leap Motion controller - get one at <a href="http://leapmotion.com/">leapmotion.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/setup">Leap Motion software</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.boastr.de/">BetterTouchTool app</a></li>
        <li><a href="btt_leap_preset">BTT Leap Trainer gesture preset</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have installed the required software and downloaded the BTT Leap Trainer preset, open BTT's settings window, and import the preset. It will load all of BTT gestures and assign keyboard actions to them. These key sequences will be use by this tool to match different gestures. A full list of gestures can be seen below.</p>

        <p>For each lesson, click the <strong>Start</strong> button to begin the lesson. Then look at the <strong>Lesson Gestures</strong> for the current gesture you'll need to perform. As you perform a gesture, the next gesture will move intro place and the previous gesture will move left. The current gesture is always highlighted, and previous gestures will turn green or red depending on whether you got the gesture correctly.</p>
