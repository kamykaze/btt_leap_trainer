### Welcome to BTT Leap Trainer
This is a small project I created to help get myself used to Leap Motion's gestures using BetterTouchTool.

As Leap Motion is a completely different device from traditional mice and trackpads, a lot of people have found it difficult to use gestures in a consistent manner. Obviously, some training is required, and this project will hopefully help you with that.

## Setup
Before you can use this tool, you need to setup your Mac with Leap Motion and BetterTouchTool.

For Leap Motion settings, make sure you allow Background Apps to track information.

Then, open BetterTouchTool and load the settings files from this projects (btt_leap_preset). This will configure all the gestures available in BTT. Each gesture is configured to send a particular keystroke sequence, which the tool picks up and uses to evaluate whether the gesture done is correct or not. I am not actually tracking any Leap Motion data...simply using BTT to send keystrokes.

## Using BTT Leap Trainer
To use this tool, open the index.html page in a browser, then click on the 2nd white box (the work box). That will trigger the tool to start and you'll be able to send gestures.

### Support or Contact
I wrote this tool quickly to aid my learning process with Leap Motion. This is far from a full app, but if you enjoy or are having problems using this tool, feel free to contact me at developer.kam@gmail.com
